        My Adidas
        walked through concert doors<br>
        and roamed all over coliseum floors<br>
        I stepped on stage, at Live Aid<br>
        All the people gave and the poor got paid<br>
        And out of speakers I did speak<br>
        I wore my sneakers but I'm not a sneak<br>
        My Adidas cut the sand of a foreign land<br>
        with mic in hand I cold took command<br>
        my Adidas and me, close as can be<br>
        we make a mean team, my Adidas and me<br>
        we get around together, rhyme forever<br>
        and we won't be mad when worn in bad weather<br>
        My Adidas<br>
        My Adidas<br><br>
        My Adidas
        
        standin on 2 Fifth St.<br>
        funky fresh and yes cold on my feet<br>
        with no shoe string in em, I did not win em<br>
        I bought em off the Ave with the black Lee denim<br>
        I like to sport em that's why I bought em<br>
        a sucker tried to steal em so I caught em and I fought em<br>
        and I walk down the street and I bop to the beat<br>
        with Lee on my legs and adidas on my feet<br>
        and now I just standin here shooting the gift<br>
        me and D and my Adidas standing on 2 Fifth<br><br>

      <ul class="two">
        <li>My Adidas</li>
        <li>My Adidas</li>
    </ul>
        
        Now
        me and my Adidas do the illest things<br>
        we like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings<br>
        we slay all suckers who perpetrate<br>
        and lay down law from state to state<br>
        we travel on gravel, dirt road or street<br>
        I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat<br>
        on stage front page every show I go<br>
        it's Adidas on my feet high top or low<br><br>
        
        <ol class="two">
        <li>My Adidas</li>
        <li>My Adidas</li>
        </ol>
        
        Now the Adidas I possess for one man is rare<br>
        myself homeboy got 50 pair<br>
        got blue and black cause I like to chill<br>
        and yellow and green when it's time to get ill<br>
        got a pair that I wear when I'm playin ball<br>
        with the heal inside make me 10 feet tall<br>
        my Adidas only bring good news<br>
        and they are not used as selling shoes<br>
        they're black and white, white with black stripe<br>
        the ones I like to wear when I rock the mic<br>
        on the strength of our famous university<br>
        we took the beat from the street and put it on TV<br>
        my Adidas are seen on the movie screen<br>
        Hollywood knows we're good if you know what I mean<br>
        we started in the alley, now we chill in Cali<br>
        and I won't trade my Adidas for no beat up Bally's<br>
        My Adidas<br>
